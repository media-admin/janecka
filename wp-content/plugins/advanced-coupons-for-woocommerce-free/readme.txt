Here are some FREE VERSION coupon features at a glance:

= WooCommerce BOGO Coupon Deals =

***WooCommerce BOGO coupons***, otherwise known as Buy One Get One coupon deals, are VERY common in the offline world. So why can't you run those kinds of deals on your WooCommerce store as well?!

Now you can – Advanced Coupons WooCommerce BOGO coupons let you easily run a BOGO deal (Buy One Get One deal) on your store.

It's a much more flexible WooCommerce coupon type compared to straight discounts that your customers will love! It's also much more profitable for your store as well when compared to standard discount coupons (read on).

= Protection For Your Profits With Cart Conditions (Advance Coupon Rules) =

WooCommerce coupon misuse is a huge problem for store owners worldwide. Smart store owners are using coupon rules, what we call "Cart Conditions", to reduce this significantly. By setting the right conditions on your WooCommerce coupons you can control exactly when they are allowed to be used.

For example:
* Only apply a coupon when products from a particular category are in the cart
* Only apply a coupon after a subtotal has been reached
* Only apply a coupon when a specific product is in the cart in a specific quantity
* Only apply a coupon on their first use (check their total spend is zero!)

And there's dozens more! You can also combine and mix and match cart conditions to create more specific coupon rules.

= WooCommerce Store Credit =

***Store Credit*** can be given to any customer on your store via Coupons->Store Credit menu and in this free version of Advanced Coupons we support multiple ways to use this:

* Manually grant store credit on a per user basis via an "admin ajustment"
* Refund orders to store credit instead of refunding via the payment gateway
* Let customers use store credit on the front end of your store during their checkout process

Manually granting store credit is easy! Under Coupons->Store Credit you'll see a full dashboard showing the store credit in the system. Under Customers you can lookup a particular customer account and grant store credit to them with an "Admin Adjustment". This is excellent to use in customer service situations where you might want to grant some extra credit to keep customers happy.

Refunding orders to store credit is a great way to grant a refund without having to part with actual $. They can then use the store credit towards future orders which almost guarantees you will be able to retain the customer going forward.

Finally, logged in customers will see an option on the checkout to utilize the store credit toward their order, this appears on the checkout totals box with an easy to use interface that works well with any theme. This smart detection system ensures that the store credit features are only showing on your site if the customer is logged in.

We're building a smarter store credit system for WooCommerce with Advanced Coupons and there will be many new free and premium features that will utilize store credit going into the future.

= WooCommerce URL Coupons (Easily Apply WooCommerce Coupons With A Link) =

***WooCommerce URL coupons*** let you give your customers a coupon link to apply a coupon.

When they click the coupon URL it will apply the coupon to the cart so they don't have to type it.

Use WooCommerce URL coupons on buttons, images and text. Show them on your sidebar, ads, email marketing, blog posts – basically wherever you can put a link you can put a URL coupon!

= Smart Coupons Categories =

If you've been running a store for a while chances are you have dozens, if not hundreds, of WooCommerce coupons!

WooCommerce Advanced Coupons lets you get smart about how you organise your WooCommerce coupons by giving you the ability to put them into coupon categories. 

You can name categories anything, such as "Support Coupons", "Site wide coupon deals", "WooCommerce BOGO deals", "Affiliate Coupons", "Partner Offers" and more.

= Restrict WooCommerce Coupons By Role =

If you run a store with multiple user roles, (for example if you're using [WooCommerce Wholesale Prices](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-wholesale-prices/) and have wholesale customers to worry about, you will be please to know you can now create coupons that are just for those users.

Likewise, you can exclude certain user roles from being able to use WooCommerce coupons. It's very flexible!

= Show WooCommerce Coupons On Order Preview Popup =

The new quick order preview button on the Orders List in WooCommerce is great, but it doesn't show coupons that were used on the order.

Advanced Coupons will add a list of the WooCommerce coupons that were used on an order so you can quickly see without having to go into the Order edit screen. 

These small but helpful enhancements speed up your processes dramatically. We're always looking for ways to improve people's workflow.

= Advanced Coupons Is Compatible With Other Plugins =

Not only is Advanced Coupons compatible with standard WooCommerce coupons, it's also compatible with lots of complementary plugins. Hundreds of shipping and payment gateways, WooCommerce Currency Switcher by Aelia (even with our free Advanced Coupons plugin!), Wholesale Suite, WPML, WooCommerce Subscriptions coupons, plus loads more.

If you want WooCommerce coupons that are advanced AND compatible with all the existing tools you are using then Advanced Coupons is the tool for you.

= The Best WooCommerce Coupon Plugin (3 Reasons) =

When it comes to marketing your store, standard WooCommerce coupons are too underpowered to be useful. That why you need extra WooCommerce coupons features.

The mission of Advanced Coupons is to be the undisputed BEST WooCommerce coupons features extender on the market. Here are 3 top reasons you need Advanced Coupons:

**Reason #1: WooCommerce BOGO coupons are more PROFITABLE (It's simple math!)**

Let me illustrate why WooCommerce BOGO coupons make more profit by comparing a “30% off deal” offer vs. a “Buy 2 get 1 free” offer.

*Standard 30% off coupon deal*
- 1x $100 pair of Jeans (discounted to $70 after 30% off)
- Minus $30 cost price
- *$40 profit margin*

Standard WooCommerce coupons for a “30% off deal” would take 30% off the revenue meaning its $70 profit margin would get reduced to $40 profit margin.

*WooCommerce BOGO (Buy 2 get 1 free) deal*
- 3x pairs of Jeans is $300
- Minus $90 cost price ($30 cost price each)
- Minus $100 as 1x product is free for the deal
- *$110 profit margin*

Each time the customer takes the WooCommerce BOGO deal you make $110 profit. I’ll take that any day of the week.

**Reason #2: Cart Conditions save you money by smartly restricting coupon deals**

Have you ever had a customer use a coupon they weren't meant to? Did they get more discount than they were suppose to? 

Cart conditions are like a set of rules your customer needs to abide by before they can apply a coupon. And if they apply the coupon and then later become ineligible, the cart conditions will remove that coupon.

Gone are the days of losing out by having to put up with customers looking to scrape something extra. You can set up complex rules for your WooCommerce Coupons to abide by which, over time, will save you bucket loads.

**Reason #3: We're a WooCommerce coupon plugin dedicated to your success!**

There's lots of other "features" that I could give you as reasons of why this is the best WooCommerce coupon extension plugin. But really there's only one more reason you should care about: we care about your success!

Store credits are extremely easy to grant from an admin perspective. Simply visit Coupons->Store Credits, then click on the Customers tab. You'll see an option there to search for your customer.

Once you have the customer, you can adjust their store credit balance. This is called an "Admin Adjustment" and is just one way to give store credits to your customers.

In this free plugin, you can also grant store credit to a customer via refunds.

Simply choose the "Refund to Store Credit" option when on the Order Edit screen as you're refunding an order. The customer will then be able to utilize this store credit on their next order with you.
